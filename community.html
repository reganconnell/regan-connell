I had the pleasure of participating in the <a

target="_blank"><b>Bay Area Scikit-Learn
Open Source Sprint</b></a> in October 2019, hosted by WiMLDS at UCSF.

I had a wonderful experience working in an environment that

support in technical fields. I continue my involvement in
the open source community.

In January 2020, I particpated in the
  <a href="https://github.com/aiformankind/lets-stop-wildfires-hackathon" target="_blank">
<font color = "4863A0"><u>Let's Stop Wildfires Hackathon</u></font></a>
hosted at <a href = "https://www.insightdatascience.com/" target = "_blank"><font color = "4863A0"><u>Insight</u></font></a> in San Francisco

which focused on using machine learning to help solve the California
wildfire crisis. My team continues to work on a hydrid model that combines
forecasting and classification to improve detection of smoke in real-time images.

I had the pleasure of participating in the <a

target="_blank"><font color = "4863A0"><u>Bay Area Scikit-Learn
Open Source Sprint</u></font></a> in October 2019, hosted by WiMLDS at UCSF.
Here I had my first introduction to open source contribution in a one-day
hackathon working on issues in the scikit-learn Github repo. I worked on
creating a feature that can <a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/10733" target="_blank">
  <font color = "4863A0"><u>load a data bunch as a data frame.</u></font></a>

I had a wonderful experience working in an environment that
supported and promoted women and gender minorities
as members of the open source community, and I look forward
to future opportunities to help increase women's
support in technical fields. I continue my involvement in
the open source community.

Through the School of Information at UC Berkeley, a few of my friends and I began
a partnership with our campus's Facilities Services in which we undertook the task of
creating an accessible, centralized, visual record of the department's data.

<br>
<br>

The Facilities Services department works to maintain a campus
that is conducive to teaching, learning, and research. This requires
overseeing an agenda that processes thousands of requests
daily for items that need attention on campus, which includes deciding how to best
allocate limited resources. The order requests can range from
a burnt out lightbulb in a classroom, to destructive temperatures in
a multi-million dollar research lab. The magnitude of the requests
they receive and variation in urgency of requests makes the Facilities
Services' job a hard one. This
is where we came in.

<br>
<br>

  Given a snapshot of data the department had generated, we set out to
  help them better understand how and where their resources were being deployed, as well
  as how to improve the process of priortizing requests by urgency.

  We designed a website that tells the story of UC Berkeley Facilities
   Services data. We provide information and visualizations to help their management
    assist customers, and also take away specific information that inform actions and
   provide useful insights.
<br>
<br>

    Our data exploration also
    revealed discrepancies in their data that helped them identify flaws in
    data processing systems and storing formats.

    <br>
    <br>

    We are very grateful to have worked with the Facilities Services at UC berkeley
    for the opportunity to create a valuable deliverable that will help this department
    fulfill their mission of keeping campus up and running for all.

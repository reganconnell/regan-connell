Hi, my name's Regan.
<br>
<br>
I am a Data Scientist at Mist Systems, an AI startup owned by Juniper Networks.
I graduated from UC Berkeley in Fall 2020 with a degree in Data Science,
and an emphasis on Sustainable Engineering. My overarching interest lies in supporting technology to develop
innovative solutions for social good. I enjoy the technical challenges of <b>Software Engineering</b>
and <b>Data Science</b> and find time to develop my skills in both domains.
I created this website to host a portfolio of the projects I have
worked on. These
projects include personally motivated analyses, community supporting experiences,
and professionally based
partnerships.

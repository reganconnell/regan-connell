Hi, my name's Regan. I'm from Sonoma County, California.
<br>
<br>
I am an undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying Data Science, emphasizing
in Sustainable Engineering. My overarching interest lies in using technology to develop
innovative solutions for social good. I'm interested in both Software Engineering
and Data Science and continue to develop my skills in both domains.
I created this website as a portfolio for the projects I have
worked on, both personally motivated and through professional partnerships.
<br>
<br>
Shoutout to Jekyll for their lovely web dev software.
You can find this website hosted on my github.

<!-- One of the domains of social good I am particularly interested in
in is environmental issues due to my personal love of the outdoors.

Aside from the professional stuff, I fully relish in all of the human experiences
life has to offer—— watching live music, Sunday
farmer's markets, skiing trips in Tahoe, refining my ~amateur~ wine pallet, and
going on runs in new places.

to improve issues in the realm of social good.

<br>
  As the U.S. climate becomes more volatile and the population continues
  to rise, informed water use is as important as ever.
   Myself and a friend of mine, Nathan Jeffries,
   set out to further <b>explore urban water use</b> after realizing
   that there is limited publicly
   available data about city-level water use across the
   United States. The motivation behind this project was to fill in geographic data gaps
   which may help better inform policy decisions and
   improve the use of two vital resources— water and energy.

<br>
<br>
   We aimed to
   generate a predictive model for
   urban water use, as well as a model able to predict the amount of
   electricity needed to process and distribute water,
   an important part of the <a href = "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017WR022265" target = "_blank"><b><font color = "4863A0">
     energy-water nexus.</font></b></a>
  These models fall under the category
  of Land Use Regression, or spatial prediction.
  We explored four types of models: K Nearest Neighbors, Linear regression,
   Ridge regression, and Lasso regression.
<br>
<br>
<font size = "+1"><b>Conclusions</b></font>
<br>
  We found that KNN
  and Ridge models for water use prediction perform the best overall, performing
 better for the
  larger, higher water consuming cities.

   None of our models for processing-electricity
    performed well which is
    predominately due to the variation in the types of energy
    cities use to process their drinking water, be that natural gas, coal, electricity, or others.

    <!-- Poor predictions may also be due to fluctuating
    levels of technology across the country— some cities have much more
    advanced energy-saving technologies than others. Next steps include looking into features
    that may indicate advanceness of technology in cities to better predict
    their electricity use for drinking water processing, as well as finding more complete
    data for total processing energy use. -->

    <br>
    <br>
    The main takeaway from this project is that more primary data
    is necessary in order to develop accurate prediction models for urban water use, as well
    as processing energy use.
    The findings of this project may motivate agencies to prioritize resources towards better
    data collection of water use in order to illuminate our society's consumption of this
    precious, declining resource.

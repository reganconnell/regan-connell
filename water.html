  As the U.S. climate becomes more volatile and the population continues
  to rise, informed water use is as important as ever.
   The aim of this project is to generate various predictive models for
   urban water use with climate, demographic, and geographic data.
   Additionally, models are generated to predict the amount of
   electricity needed to process and distribute water consumed by cities.
   <br>
   <br>
  The models developed in this project fall under the category
  of Land Use Regression, or spatial prediction. There is limited publicly
  available data about city-level water use across the
  United States, and the motivation behind this project is to fill in geographic data gaps
  which may help better inform policy decisions and
  improve the use of two vital resources— water and energy.
<br>
<br>
  Four models are developed for both drinking water
  per capita predictions and electricity per capita predictions for drinking water
  processing, including K Nearest Neighbors, Linear regression,
   Ridge regression, and Lasso regression.
<br>
<br>
  The takeaways from this project are that the KNN
  and Ridge models for water per capita prediction perform the best overall. Both of
  these models performs significantly better for the
  larger, higher water consuming cities, and the predicitons for smaller,
  lower water consuming cities had much too high of a margin to be informative.
   No single feature in the climate, demographic, and geographic data used to train
   the models dominated the predictions generated.
   <br>
   <br>
   None of the models developed for
    electricity per capita usage made well-performing predictions, which is
    predominately due to the variation in the types of energy
    cities use to process their drinking water, be that natural gas, coal, electricity, or others.

    Poor predictions may also be due to fluctuating
    levels of technology across the country— some cities have much more
    advanced energy-saving technologies than others. Next steps include looking into features
    that may indicate advanceness of technology in cities to better predict
    their electricity use for drinking water processing, as well as finding more complete
    data for total processing energy use.

    <br>
    <br>
    The main takeaway from this project is that more primary data
    is necessary in order to develop accurate prediction models for urban water use, as well
    as processing energy use.
    The findings of this project may motivate agencies to prioritize resources towards better
    data collection of water use in order to illuminate our society's consumption of this
    precious, declining resource.
